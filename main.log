Node Supervisor is used to restart programs when they crash.
It can also be used to restart programs when a *.js file changes.

Usage:
  supervisor [options] <program>
  supervisor [options] -- <program> [args ...]

Required:
  <program>
    The program to run.

Options:
  -w|--watch <watchItems>
    A comma-delimited list of folders or js files to watch for changes.
    When a change to a js file occurs, reload the program
    Default is '.'

  -i|--ignore <ignoreItems>
    A comma-delimited list of folders to ignore for changes.
    No default

  -p|--poll-interval <milliseconds>
    How often to poll watched files for changes.
    Defaults to Node default.

  -e|--extensions <extensions>
    Specific file extensions to watch in addition to defaults.
    Used when --watch option includes folders
    Default is 'node|js'

  -x|--exec <executable>
    The executable that runs the specified program.
    Default is 'node'

  --debug
    Start node with --debug flag.

  --debug-brk
    Start node with --debug-brk flag.

  -n|--no-restart-on error|exit
    Don't automatically restart the supervised program if it ends.
    Supervisor will wait for a change in the source files.
    If "error", an exit code of 0 will still restart.
    If "exit", no restart regardless of exit code.
